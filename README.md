# Read Me

I'm experimenting with the application Obsidian for note taking. My Obsidian setup is as follows:

- 1_inbox
- 2_Literature Notes
- 3_Permanent Notes
- Templates
- x_Images

This repo contains the items in the Templates folder. It's based off of [GitHub - groepl/Obsidian-Templates: A repository containing templates and scripts for #Obsidian to support the #Zettelkasten method for note-taking.](https://github.com/groepl/Obsidian-Templates).
